If so, briefly note any potential brand compliance concerns:\n\n1. For style files: Look for hardcoded hex colors (should use CSS variables), hardcoded font families (should use brand fonts), arbitrary pixel values for spacing\n\n2. For UI files: Look for generic button labels (Submit, OK, Click here), technical error messages, words that might conflict with brand voice\n\nIf no concerns or file is not brand-relevant, respond with just 'No brand concerns.' Otherwise, briefly list 1-3 key concerns to investigate. Keep response under 100 words.\n\nFile: $TOOL_INPUT",
